Enhancing Memory Retention By Increasing Alpha waves and Decreasing Beta waves :

ABSTRACT :

Brain waves can aptly define the state of a personâ€™s mind. High
activity and attention lead to dominant beta waves while
relaxation and focus lead to dominant alpha waves in the brain.
Alpha state of mind is ideal for learning and memory retention. In
our experiment we aim to increase alpha waves in a person with
the help of music to measure improvement in memory retention.
Our hypothesis is that, when a person listens to music which
causes relaxation, he is more likely to attain the alpha state of
mind and enhance his memory retention ability. To verify this
hypothesis, we conducted an experiment on multiple participants.
The participants were asked to take a similar quiz twice, under
different states of mind. During the experimentation process, the
brain activity of the participants was recorded and analyzed using
MUSE, an off-the-shelf device for brainwave capturing and
analysis.
